## Objective
To discuss the API integration of ASR, MT, and TTS models for real-time speech processing, focusing on English-to-Hindi translation using Anuvaadhub.io.

## Goals
| Type | Description | Owner | Deadline |
|------|-------------|--------|----------|
| T | Integrate the localhost tested ASR API with RabbitMQ to process English WAV files and convert English speech to text| Varun, Akash | March 19, 2025 |
| T | Integrate the localhost tested MT API using RabbitMQ to translate English text to Hindi | Arya, Karthik | March 19, 2025 |
| T | Integrate the localhost tested TTS API using RabbitMQ to convert Hindi text to speech | Karthik, Akash | March 19, 2025 |
| T | Handle audio with different wpm and look into errors and edge cases| Varun,Arya | March 26, 2025 |
| T | Modify generateaudio code to handle pushing audio files into ASR input queue and hadling multiple packets | Prashant | March 19, 2025 |
| D | Integrate the localhost implemented test code with the existing code  | - | - |
| D | Ensure compatibility with Anuvaadhub.io models | - | - |
| D | Validate ASR,MT,TTS output before passing to next model | - | - |
| I | System will handle real-time speech translation | - | - |
| I | Logs and error handling will be incorporated for debugging | - | - |

## Next Steps
- Implement and test all testcases and egdecases with the integrated code.
- Handle threshold times for sample WAV files.
- Schedule a follow-up meeting for progress review

## Date of Next Meeting
Wednesday, March 19, 2025, 5:15 PM

## Additional Notes
- Ensure API request and response handling is optimized for performance
- Proper error handling to manage API failures and timeouts
- Logs should capture request payloads and API responses for debugging
