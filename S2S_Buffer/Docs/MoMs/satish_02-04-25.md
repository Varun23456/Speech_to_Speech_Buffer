# Minutes of Meeting (MoM) - 12

## Meeting Details
- **Date & Time:** March 02, 2025, 5:00 PM  
- **Location:** Product Labs  
- **Meeting Title:** Testing  

---

## Participants
- **Team:** Karthik Venkat, Mahendraker Arya, Akash Sigullapalli, Varun Alokam, Prashant Kumar  
- **Client:** Satish, Nikunj  
- **Interns/Owners:** -  
- **Absent Participants:** None  

---

## Objective
To identify and develop comprehensive test cases for API behavior, timeout scenarios, and server crashes. The meeting focused on planning and executing unit, integration, and end-to-end testing to ensure system stability and performance.

---

## Summary of Discussion
- Reviewed the current chunking logic and explained how Anuvaad Streaming API performs chunking.
- Discussed the internal workings of the Anuvaad Streaming API.
- Compared the Anuvaad Streaming API with Google Streaming API in terms of performance and structure.
- Outlined the testing approaches needed to validate system robustness and API responsiveness.

---

## Pending Tasks
- **Chunking Logic:** Integrate chunking mechanism to support Streamline ASR once Anuvaad Streaming APIs are available.
- **API Testing:** Develop test cases for typical and edge-case API scenarios including error and timeout handling.
- **Timeout Handling:** Simulate and test various timeout conditions for response consistency and fallback behavior.
- **Crash Recovery:** Test how the system responds to unexpected server failures and ensure proper recovery and logging.
- **Test Strategy:** Conduct a complete testing cycleâ€”unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
