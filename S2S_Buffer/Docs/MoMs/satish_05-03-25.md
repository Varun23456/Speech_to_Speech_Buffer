## Objective
To discuss the API integration of ASR, MT, and TTS models for real-time speech processing, focusing on English-to-Hindi translation using Anuvaadhub.io.

## Goals
| Type | Description | Owner | Deadline |
|------|-------------|--------|----------|
| T | Integrate ASR API to process English WAV files and convert speech to text | Varun, Akash | March 12, 2025 |
| T | Implement MT API to translate English text to Hindi | Arya, Karthik | March 12, 2025 |
| T | Use TTS API to convert Hindi text to speech | Karthik, Akash | March 12, 2025 |
| T | Fetch models from Anuvaadhub.io and handle authentication with API tokens | Arya, Varun | March 12, 2025 |
| T | Test end-to-end flow from ASR to MT to TTS | Prashant | March 12, 2025 |
| D | API calls will use JSON payloads and handle authentication tokens | - | - |
| D | Ensure compatibility with Anuvaadhub.io models | - | - |
| D | Use FastAPI for server-side integration | - | - |
| D | Validate ASR output before passing to MT | - | - |
| I | System will handle real-time speech translation | - | - |
| I | Buffering mechanism will be implemented for smooth transitions | - | - |
| I | Logs and error handling will be incorporated for debugging | - | - |

## Next Steps
- Implement and test API calls for ASR, MT, and TTS
- Validate and refine pipeline behavior with sample WAV files
- Schedule a follow-up meeting for progress review

## Date of Next Meeting
Wednesday, March 12, 2025, 5:15 PM

## Additional Notes
- Ensure API request and response handling is optimized for performance
- Proper error handling to manage API failures and timeouts
- Logs should capture request payloads and API responses for debugging
