# Minutes of Meeting (MoM)-10

## Meeting Details
- **Date and Time:** March 19, 2025, 5:30 PM
- **Location:** Product Labs
- **Meeting Title:** API Integration for Real-Time Speech Processing

## Participants
- **Team:** Karthik Venkat, Mahendraker Arya, Akash Sigullapalli, Varun Alokam, Prashant Kumar
- **Client:** Satish, Nikunj
- **Interns/Owners:** -
- **Absent Participants:** None

## Objective
To discuss project progress, features of release 1 and release 2, address challenges faced during development, and plan the next steps for API integration and testing.

## Summary of Discussion
- Formalized the presentation after reviewing the slides.
- Discussed features related to the client and the overall project.
- Covered the problem statement, project goals, and scope.
- Outlined features for **Release 1** and **Release 2**.
- Highlighted challenges faced during the process and potential solutions.
- Planned to test the application on different systems for performance analysis and reliability.

## Pending Tasks
- **Chunking:** We did not implement chunking of data yet.
- **Timeouts:** Need to add timeouts for API requests and responses.
- **API Rate Limiting:** In scenarios where only **K** API calls per minute are allowed, we need to implement rate-limiting to ensure the system adheres to this limit.

## Goals
| Type | Description | Owner | Deadline |
|------|-------------|--------|----------|
| T | Implement chunking for large payloads to avoid data loss | Varun, Akash | March 24, 2025 |
| T | Add timeout mechanisms for API requests | Arya, Karthik | March 24, 2025 |
| T | Implement rate-limiting to restrict API calls to K per minute | Karthik, Akash | March 24, 2025 |
| T | Run servers on different systems and environments to ensure robustness | Prashant | March 24, 2025 |
| D | Validate message formats for all API calls | - | - |
| D | Ensure API responses are handled gracefully | - | - |
| I | Incorporate error logs for tracking failed API requests | - | - |

## Next Steps
- Add chunking mechanism and rate-limiting to API calls.
- Implement timeout handling to prevent API delays.
- Test system on different environments for consistency.
- Review and optimize performance based on test results.

## Date of Next Meeting
Wednesday, March 26, 2025, 5:30 PM

## Additional Notes
- Ensure proper handling of API request failures and retries.
- Validate data integrity during chunked data transmission.
- Logs should capture API requests, responses, and errors for troubleshooting.
