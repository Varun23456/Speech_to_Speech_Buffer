| T | Develop Python servers for queue management | Team wide | January 29, 2025 |
| T | Design and test buffer systems for managing delays | Team wide | January 29, 2025 |
| T | Draft high-level architecture and function designs | Team wide | January 29, 2025 |
| D | RabbitMQ will be hosted locally for ease of testing | - | - |
| D | Introduce artificial latencies to queues for realistic pipeline simulation | - | - |
| D | Use FastAPI for implementing and managing latency in the pipeline | - | - |
| D | Maintain a running system architecture document updated weekly | - | - |
| I | Phase 3 will involve playing audio from the buffer (if time permits) | - | - |
| I | RabbitMQ will be hosted on a local machine for development | - | - |
| I | FastAPI tutorials are essential for pipeline functionality | - | - |
| I | Research articles from medium.com will be used for RabbitMQ integration | - | - |
| I | Code must handle various error conditions (payload errors, timeouts) | - | - |

## Next Steps
- Finalize RabbitMQ setup and start implementation
- Focus on learning FastAPI and RabbitMQ integration
- Ensure the development process accounts for robustness and error handling
- Deliver initial results and updates during the next meeting

## Date of Next Meeting
Wednesday, January 29, 2025, 5:15 PM

## Additional Notes
- Ensure functions are modular and well-documented for readability and maintainability
- Testing should focus on latency handling, error resilience, and real-time processing
- Maintain communication within the team to address roadblocks promptly
