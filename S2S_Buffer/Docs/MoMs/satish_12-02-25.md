## Objective
To discuss the details of the test plan document, next steps for API development, and tasks for the upcoming week.

## Goals
- **Tasks** (T) - has an Owner and a deadline
- **Decisions** (D)  
- **Information** (I) - everything else of interest  

| Type | Description | Owner | Deadline |
|------|-------------|-------|----------|
| I    | The test plan document should include test descriptions, expected behavior, actual outcomes, and steps to reproduce issues. | - | - |
| T    | If there is an error in the system, it should be placed in an error queue due to the continuous timestamp perspective, which makes corrections impossible. | Varun | 19th Feb 2025 |
| T    | Limit the number of requests per minute when using the sandbox environment. | Arya | 3rd Mar 2025 |
| T    | Store the output of the ASR to the queue, sending the output to the T-queue one by one. | Akash | 18th Feb 2025 |
| T    | Before writing the sandbox, create PS2A, incorporating an API call on FastAPI, which will expose two APIsâ€”one for pushing and another for receiving. | Karthik | 3rd Mar 2025 |
| T    | Write a FastAPI server that exposes an API which takes a JSON file, sends it to an API server, and returns the same API response (for testing purposes). | Varun | 3rd Mar 2025 |
| T    | Update the requirements and design document to include the FastAPI components and the interfaces for both the queue and API. Include URLs for MT and TTS. | Karthik | 19th Feb 2025 |
| T    | Implement logging for every message that falls into or out of the queue. | Arya | 17th Feb 2025 |
| T    | Handle conditions for timeouts and internet connectivity issues, particularly for API calls. | Prashant | 19th Feb 2025 |

## Next Steps
- Continue with API development tasks as assigned.
- Implement error queue handling and logging system.
- Update the documentation with the latest changes.

## Additional Notes
- The team discussed the continuous timestamp perspective's impact on error handling, which will necessitate placing errors in an error queue for later review.  
- Everyone is expected to complete their tasks by February 16, 2025, for the next phase of testing and implementation.
