## Meeting Details
- **Date and Time:** February 19, 2025  
- **Location:** Product Labs  
- **Meeting Title:** Code Review Feedback and Phase 2 Development Discussion  

## Participants
- **Team:** Karthik Venkat, Mahendraker Arya, Akash Sigullapalli, Varun Alokam, Prashant Kumar  
- **Client:** Satish, Nikunj  
- **Interns/Owners:** -  
- **Absent Participants:** None  

## Objective
To discuss feedback from the recent code review, review changes made, update design documents, and plan the start of Phase 2, including the integration of dummy APIs.

## Goals
- **Tasks** (T) - has an Owner and a deadline  
- **Decisions** (D)  
- **Information** (I) - everything else of interest  

| Type | Description | Owner | Deadline |
|------|-------------|-------|----------|
| I    | Feedback from code review was incorporated, and adjustments were made to the queue handling. Specifically, a Loq\_queue and another queue were created. | - | - |
| T    | Update the design document to reflect the changes in Phase 2, including integrating APIs for MT and TTS. | Karthik | February 25, 2025 |
| T    | Begin Phase 2 development: Connect to a dummy API for MT and TTS, call the API, and add the response back to the queue. | Akash | February 27, 2025 |
| T    | Research on how to call an API inside FastAPI for Phase 2, specifically for MT and TTS APIs. | Varun | February 26, 2025 |
| T    | Start documenting Phase 2 details, including Phase 3 (ASR and wav file handling). | Prashant | February 26, 2025 |
| T    | Implement the API call handling inside FastAPI and ensure that the real API connects with the sandbox. | Arya | February 28, 2025 |
| T    | Avoid queue deletion after adding items to the queue, ensure proper error handling. | Varun | February 27, 2025 |
| D    | No need to create a new sandbox for Phase 2, as the existing sandbox will be used for testing with dummy data. | - | - |
| D    | The test plan document does not need to be updated at this stage, as the focus is now on design updates and API integration. | - | - |
| I    | Phase 2 will focus on connecting to a dummy API for MT and TTS. The sandbox is already available, so no new sandbox is required. | - | - |
| I    | The development for Phase 2 involves integrating the API calls inside FastAPI and ensuring communication with real APIs in future phases. | - | - |
| I    | Phase 3 will involve ASR integration, including handling WAV file playback and API responses for ASR. | - | - |
| I    | There will be no need to update the test planner at this stage. The focus will be on design updates and implementation. | - | - |

## Next Steps
- Continue working on design updates and API integration for Phase 2.
- Start Phase 2 development by connecting to a dummy API for MT and TTS.
- Research how to integrate API calls within FastAPI.
- Begin documenting Phase 2, with an emphasis on Phase 3 (ASR and wav file handling).

## Additional Notes
- The team discussed the recent feedback from the code review. Adjustments were made to the queue handling, including the creation of a Loq\_queue and another queue for improved management.  
- Phase 2 development will focus on connecting to a dummy API for MT and TTS, and the real API will be used in future phases.  
- The existing sandbox will be used for testing, and there is no need to create a new one for Phase 2.
- Code changes have been made based on feedback and the review with Nikunj.
